<h2 id="section1">Overview:</h2>

This is a simple web application that can solve some basic matrix operations like: Addition, Subtraction and Multiplication.  
It also gives out detailed steps by steps guide on how to perform the operations between two matrices.  
The main component that solves the matrix problem is written and packaged using Maple Software.

<h2 id="section2"> Technologies used: </h2>

+ Front-end & Back-end: Written in C# using the ASP.NET Core framework. 
+ Problem solving module: Written, compiled and packaged by Maple Software. 


<h2 id="section3"> How it works: </h2>
<ol>
<li> First the user will input matrix's dimensions like rows and columns.</li>
<li>After that select an operation and click the button to solve.</li>
<li>Data from the user's input will be handled and put into a set of commands along with the precompiled module.</li>
<li> The instructions are given to Maple commands execution program to solve the problem.</li>
<li> The result will be an HTML file in the result folder, which the server can read to display the output to the webpage.</li>
</ol>
